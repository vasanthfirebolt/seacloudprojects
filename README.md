# Sea Cloud Project
  Sea cloud is a blockchain based P2P dapp platform for cloud storage rental service
## Objective:
   A cloud rental service based on P2P is a service that allows people to rent out their unused storage to other users who need them. The service is based on peer-to-peer (P2P) technology, which means that there is no central server or intermediary involved. The users can directly communicate and exchange data with each other.

  The objective of such a service is to provide a more efficient, affordable, and decentralized way of using cloud computing resources. By renting out their idle resources, the users can earn money or credits that they can use to access other resources on the network. By renting from other users, they can save money and utilize more flexibility and scalability than traditional cloud hosting services.
